The goal of dawaR is to make access to the Danish Web Address API convenient for many more users.

## TO DO before CRAN-submission

- [x] Tests should pass in CI as well as locally.
  - I used to have problems with a dependency that would convert the time column provided by `get_map_data()`. It is fixed with commit `23ade73`.
  *- I currently have an issue with the date-time column is converted to local time instead of UTC as is provided by the API. This causes differences between my local development machine and Github Actions.*
- [ ] Provide examples of getting data and using both reverse lookup and autocomplete functions
- [x] Write reverse lookup function to wrap in section functions
- [x] Write autocomplete function to wrap in section functions
- [ ] Choose some often-used sections to create specific functions for
  - These will basically be wrappers for other functions in the package and will provide another level of convenience for non-technical users.

## Installation

Once the package is on cran;
You can install `{dawaR}` from CRAN with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("dawaR")
```


You can install the development version of dawaR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("aleksanderbl29/dawaR")
```

To use the `get_map_data()` functions on MacOS you need to install the `{sf}` package from source [following the official instructions](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf?tab=readme-ov-file#macos).

## Examples

This package has multiple use cases, though they all revolve around data from the Danish Web Address API.

### Using DAWA map data

The function `get_map_data()` fetches data in `geojson` format and transforms the geometries to `{sf}` polygons. These polygons can be drawn as nice maps with `{ggplot2}`.

```{r municipality_map}
library(dawaR)
library(ggplot2)

municipalities <- get_map_data("kommuner")
ggplot(municipalities, aes(fill = regionsnavn)) +
  geom_sf(color = "black") +
  cowplot::theme_map()
```
