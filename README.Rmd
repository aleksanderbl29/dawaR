The goal of `{dawaR}` is to make access to the Danish Web Address API convenient for many more users.

## Installation

```{r check_cran, include=FALSE}
if (!require(available)) install.packages("available")
is_on_cran <- !available::available_on_cran("dawaR")
```

```{r cran_instruct, echo=FALSE, results='asis', eval=is_on_cran}
cat("You can install `{dawaR}` from CRAN with:")
```

```{r cran_code, eval=FALSE, include=is_on_cran}
install.packages("dawaR")
```

```{r r_universe_instruct, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
if (is_on_cran) {
  cat("Or you can install `{dawaR}` from r-universe with:")
} else if (!is_on_cran) {
  cat("You can install `{dawaR}` from r-universe with:")
}
```

```{r r_universe, eval=FALSE, include=!is_on_cran}
install.packages(
  "dawaR",
  repos = c(
    aleksanderbl29 = "https://aleksanderbl29.r-universe.dev",
    getOption("repos")
  )
)
```

You can install the development version of `{dawaR}` from [GitHub](https://github.com/aleksanderbl29/dawaR) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("aleksanderbl29/dawaR")
```

If you install the package in an environment configured with [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) on MacOS, please consult `vignette("renv-issues")` to ensure that `get_map_data()` works as intended.

## Usage

Be sure to see the [getting started](articles/dawaR.html) and the [guide on how to make maps with {dawaR}](articles//printing_maps.html).

## DAWA *will* be phased out

The government entity that maintains the Danish Web Address API has disclosed that the API will be phased out at some point. When that time comes, this package will become deprecated and I will have another package ready to provide the same functionality. The service that is to replace DAWA is called Datafordeleren (The Data Distribution) and is in the works. Some functionality in relation to The Central Register of Buildings (BBR) has already been moved to the new service.

If you know how to read danish (or use machine-translation) you can keep yourself up to date on [this page](https://dataforsyningen.dk/data/4924).

But no worries! It does not sound like the shutdown of DAWA will happen anytime soon or without due notice. You can read more about this and read the history of updates in `vignette("status")`. Any minor updates will be shown there. Major ones will be on this page. Both will be communicated with `lifecycle` in the functions.
